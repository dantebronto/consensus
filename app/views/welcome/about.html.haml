  The consensus project is intended to assist in the operation of worker cooperatives. in a worker's cooperative, employees act in a hybrid capacity as worker, owner, and manager. read about what makes a cooperative a "worker cooperative"

  benefits of such a working arrangement include:

%ul
  %li democratic control - everyone has a voice in operating procedures
  %li self ownership - workers take pride and initiative
  %li fair remuneration - payment based more on actual effort or contribution 
  %li efficiency - no more exorbitant expenditure on a potentially ineffective management layer. you don't need someone to crack the whip when people are self motivated.
  %li professional improvement - it is in the best interest of a coop to hire workers who can "wear many hats" (balanced job complexes)
  
%p the main tradeoff with this mode of organization is time. workers will undoubtedly spend more time in an administrative capacity as opposed to a specific, potentially rote, task.

  the transition to a democratic workplace can be difficult. after spending extensive time in our deeply

    1. decision making -  
  consensus provides a polling suite allowing for several vote types. single option, multi-option, prioritization and allocation. organizations can hold internal votes on policy, and almost instantly see transparent results.

    2. profit sharing -  
  workers who act as owners need to be concerned with payment. in combination with the voting tools, consensus allows you to determine employee / partner payouts based on dimensions like tenure, hours worked, and capital contributions. you can even choose to include subjective metrics of contribution via a peer review tool.

%p this video has the production value of a 80s educational video, but it shows a really complete idea of what this software is about.
